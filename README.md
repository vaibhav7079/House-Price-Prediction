# House-Price-Prediction

House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Objective: The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the House Price Prediction Dataset.

Prepare the dataset for machine learning. This includes loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame and visualizing data features using Matplotlib for a better understanding (e.g., barplot).
Explore and analyze the correlation between features using Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset.
Build a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms to predict house prices.
Evaluate the performance of the model and fine-tune it for better results.
